Wonderful doctor
The following story is not the fruit of idle fiction. Everything that I have described really happened in Kiev about thirty years ago and is still sacred, to the smallest detail, preserved in the traditions of the family in question. For my part, I have only changed the names of some of the characters in this touching story and given the oral narrative a written form.
— Grish, and Grish! Look at that piglet… Laughs... yeah. And in his mouth!.. Look, look... weed in your mouth, by God, weed!.. That's the thing!
And the two boys standing in front of the huge, one-piece glass window of the grocery store began to laugh uncontrollably, elbowing each other in the side, but involuntarily dancing from the cruel cold. They had been standing in front of this magnificent exhibition for more than five minutes, exciting their minds and stomachs in equal measure. Here, illuminated by the bright light of hanging lamps, whole mountains of strong red apples and oranges towered; there were regular pyramids of tangerines, gently gilding through the tissue paper enveloping them; huge smoked and pickled fish stretched out on dishes, ugly mouths agape and eyes bulging; below, surrounded by garlands of sausages, juicy sliced hams with a thick layer of pinkish fat flaunted... Countless jars and boxes of salted, boiled and smoked snacks completed this spectacular picture, looking at which both boys for a moment forgot about the twelve-degree frost and about the important task entrusted to them by their mother, an assignment that ended so unexpectedly and so lamentably.
The eldest boy was the first to break away from the contemplation of the charming sight. He tugged at his brother's sleeve and said sternly:
— Well, Volodya, let's go, let's go... there's nothing here…
At the same time suppressing a heavy sigh (the eldest of them was only ten years old, and besides, both had eaten nothing since morning except empty cabbage soup) and casting a last amorous and greedy glance at the gastronomic exhibition, the boys hurriedly ran down the street. Sometimes, through the fogged windows of some house, they saw a Christmas tree, which from a distance seemed like a huge cluster of bright, shining spots, sometimes they even heard the sounds of a cheerful polka… But they courageously drove away the tempting thought: stop for a few seconds and stick their eyes to the glass.
As the boys walked, the streets became less crowded and darker. Beautiful shops, shining Christmas trees, trotters racing under their blue and red nets, the screeching of runners, the festive animation of the crowd, the cheerful hum of shouts and conversations, the laughing faces of elegant ladies flushed with frost — everything was left behind. There were vacant lots, crooked, narrow alleys, gloomy, unlit slopes... Finally they reached a rickety dilapidated house that stood apart; its bottom — the basement itself — was stone, and the top was wooden. Having bypassed the cramped, icy and dirty courtyard, which served as a natural garbage pit for all the residents, they went down to the basement, walked through a common corridor in the dark, groped for their door and opened it.
The Mertsalovs had been living in this dungeon for over a year. Both boys had long since become accustomed to these sooty walls crying from dampness, and to wet rags drying on a rope stretched across the room, and to this terrible smell of kerosene smoke, children's dirty laundry and rats — the real smell of poverty. But today, after everything they had seen on the street, after this festive jubilation that they felt everywhere, their little children's hearts were squeezed by acute, unchildlike suffering. In the corner, on a dirty wide bed, lay a girl of about seven years old; her face was burning, her breathing was short and labored, her wide-open, shining eyes stared intently and aimlessly. Next to the bed, in a cradle suspended from the ceiling, an infant screamed, wincing, straining and choking. A tall, thin woman, with a haggard, tired face, as if blackened with grief, knelt beside the sick girl, adjusting her pillow and at the same time not forgetting to nudge the rocking cradle with her elbow. When the boys entered and white clouds of frosty air rushed into the basement after them, the woman turned her worried face back.
— Well? What is it? "What is it?" she asked abruptly and impatiently.
The boys were silent. Only Grisha noisily wiped his nose with the sleeve of his coat, which had been converted from an old cotton bathrobe.
— Did you take the letter?.. Grisha, I'm asking you, did you give me the letter?
— I gave it away, — Grisha replied in a hoarse voice from the frost,
— Well, what about it? What did you tell him?
— Yes, everything is as you taught. Here, I say, is a letter from Mertsalov, from your former manager. And he cursed us: "Get out of here, he says… You bastards..."
— But who is it? Who was talking to you?.. Speak plainly, Grisha!
— The doorman was talking… Who else? I said to him, "Take the letter, uncle, give it to me, and I'll wait for an answer down here." And he says, "Well, he says, keep your pocket... the master also has time to read your letters..."
— Well, and you?
— I told him everything, as you taught,: "There's nothing to eat, they say... Masha is sick… He's dying..." I say, "As soon as Dad finds a place, he'll thank you, Savely Petrovich, by God, he'll thank you." Well, at this time, the bell rings as it rings, and he tells us: "Get the hell out of here! So that your spirit is not here!.." And even hit Volodya on the back of the head.
"And he hit me on the back of the head," said Volodya, who was following his brother's story with attention, and scratched the back of his head.
The older boy suddenly began to rummage anxiously in the deep pockets of his robe. Finally pulling out a crumpled envelope, he put it on the table and said:
— Here it is, a letter…
My mother didn't ask any more questions. For a long time in the stuffy, dank room, only the frantic cry of the baby and the short, rapid breathing of Masha, more like continuous monotonous moans, could be heard. Suddenly the mother said, turning back:

— There's borscht there, left over from lunch… Would you like to eat? Only cold, there's nothing to warm it up with…
At that moment, someone's uncertain footsteps were heard in the corridor and the rustle of a hand searching for a door in the dark. The mother and the two boys—all three of them even turned pale from the intense expectation—turned in this direction.
Mertsalov entered. He was wearing a summer coat, a summer felt hat and no galoshes. His hands were swollen and blue from the cold, his eyes were sunken, his cheeks were stuck around his gums, like a dead man's. He didn't say a single word to his wife, she didn't ask him a single question. They understood each other by the despair they saw in each other's eyes.
In this terrible, fateful year, misfortune after misfortune persistently and mercilessly rained down on Mertsalov and his family. At first, he himself fell ill with typhoid fever, and all their meager savings were spent on his treatment. Then, when he recovered, he found out that his place, the modest place of a house manager for twenty-five rubles a month, was already occupied by another... A desperate, convulsive pursuit of casual work, correspondence, an insignificant place, a pledge and re-pledge of things, the sale of all household rags began. And then the children started to get sick. Three months ago, one girl died, and now the other is lying in the heat and unconscious. Elizaveta Ivanovna had to simultaneously take care of a sick girl, breastfeed a little one and go almost to the other side of the city to the house where she washed clothes on a daily basis.
I've been busy all day trying to squeeze out at least a few kopecks for Masha's medicine through superhuman efforts. To this end, Mertsalov ran around almost half the city, begging and humiliating himself everywhere; Elizaveta Ivanovna went to her mistress, the children were sent with a letter to that gentleman, there were uncertain steps and the rustle of a hand searching in the dark for the door. The mother and the two boys—all three of them even turned pale from the intense expectation—turned in this direction.
