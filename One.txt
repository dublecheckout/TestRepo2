Well, go on, go on, my cat, go on, kitty! Let's play a little bit," Nils urged him.
He leaned over the arm of the chair and gently tickled the cat behind the ear.
It was very pleasant: the cat immediately softened, purred and began to rub against Nils's leg.
And Nils was just waiting for that.
One time!— and the cat hung on its own tail.
— Mya-a-a-u! — the cat screamed shrilly.
— Ay-ay-ay! Nils shouted even louder and threw the cat away: twisting in the air, the cat still managed to stroke Nils with its claws.
That was the end of their game.
The cat ran away, and Nils turned back to his book.
But he didn't read much. For some reason, the letters began to jump in front of his eyes, the lines then merged, then scattered... Nils himself did not notice how he fell asleep.

Nils did not sleep for long — he was awakened by a rustle.
Nils lifted his head. The mirror that hung over the table reflected the whole room.
Stretching out his neck, Nils began to peer intently into the mirror.
There was no one in the room.
And suddenly Nils saw that the chest in which his mother kept her festive dresses was open for some reason.
Nils was scared. Maybe while he was sleeping, a thief got into the room and is now hiding somewhere here, behind a chest or closet?
Nils cringed and held his breath.
And then a shadow flashed in the mirror. It flashed once more. More…
Someone was crawling slowly and carefully along the edge of the chest.
A mouse? No, not a mouse.
Nils stared straight into the mirror.
What a miracle! He clearly saw a small man on the edge of the chest. This little man had a pointed cap on his head, a long-brimmed caftan reached to his feet, and red morocco boots with silver buckles on his feet.
Why, it's a dwarf! A real dwarf!
His mother often told Nils about dwarves. They live in the forest. They can speak both human, bird, and animal. They know about all the treasures that lie in the ground. If the dwarves want, flowers will bloom in the snow in winter, if they want, rivers will freeze in summer.
But why did the dwarf come here? What is he looking for in their trunk?
Here I am now," Nils whispered and pulled a butterfly net off a nail.
With one swipe, the dwarf scrambled into the net like a trapped dragonfly. His cap had slipped over his nose, and his legs were tangled in a wide caftan. He floundered helplessly and flailed his arms, trying to grab the net. But as soon as he managed to get up, Nils would shake the net, and the dwarf would fall down again.
—Listen, Nils," the dwarf finally pleaded, "let me go free!" I'll give you a gold coin for that, and one as big as the button on your shirt.
Nils thought for a moment.
"Well, that's probably not bad," he said, and stopped swinging the net.
Clinging to the sparse fabric, the dwarf deftly climbed up. Now he had already grabbed the iron hoop, and his cap appeared above the edge of the net…
Then it occurred to Nils that he had sold out. In addition to the gold coin, it was possible to demand that the dwarf learn his lessons for him. You never know what else you can come up with! The dwarf will agree to everything now! When you're sitting in a net, you won't bargain.
And Nils shook the net again.
But suddenly he received such a hefty slap on the head that the net fell out of his hands, and he rolled head over heels into a corner.

Nils lay motionless for a minute, and then, groaning and groaning, got up,
The dwarf was already gone. The chest was closed, and the butterfly net hung in its place — between the window and the closet.
— Did I dream all this, or what? Nils said and limped back to his chair.
He took two steps and stopped. Something happened to the room, the walls of their little house parted, the ceiling went up high, and the chair on which Nils always sat towered in front of him like an impregnable mountain. To climb it, Nils had to climb a twisted leg like a gnarled oak trunk.
The book was still on the table, but it was so huge that Nils couldn't make out a single letter at the top of the page. He lay down on his stomach on the book and slowly crawled from line to line, from word to word.
He was sweating profusely as he read one sentence.
— What the hell! But I won't be able to crawl to the end of the page by tomorrow," Nils said and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.
And suddenly he saw that a tiny man was looking at him from the mirror — just like the dwarf who had caught him in the net. Only he's dressed differently: in leather pants and a plaid shirt with big buttons.
"There's another one here! Nils thought.— And dressed up like that! It's like you came to visit!"
— Hey, you, what do you want here? Nils shouted and shook his fist at the little man.
The little man also shook his fist at Nils.
Nils put his hands on his hips and stuck out his tongue. The little man also put his hands on his hips and also stuck out his tongue at Nils.
Nils stamped his foot. And the little man stamped his foot.
Nils jumped, spun like a top, waved his arms, but the little man did not lag behind him. He was also jumping, spinning like a top and waving his arms.
Then Nils sat down on a book and wept bitterly. He realized that the dwarf had bewitched him and that the little man who was looking at him from the mirror was himself, Nils Holgerson.
After crying for a while, Nils wiped his eyes and decided to go look for the dwarf. Maybe if he apologized properly, the dwarf would turn him back into a boy?
Nils ran out into the yard. A sparrow was jumping in front of the house.
As soon as Nils appeared on the threshold, the sparrow flew up on the fence and screamed at the top of his sparrow voice:
— Look at Nils! Look at Nils!
And the chickens flapped their wings and clucked in unison: "Serves him right! Serves him right!
And the amazing thing is that Nils understood everyone perfectly.
The geese surrounded Nils from all sides and, stretching their necks, hissed in his ear:
Good! Well, it's good! Are you afraid now? Are you afraid? — And they pecked at him, pinched him, pecked him with their beaks, pulled his arms and legs.
Poor Nils would have had a very bad time if a flock of wild geese had not flown over their village at that time. They flew high in the sky, stretching out in a regular triangle, but when they saw their relatives — domestic geese — they descended lower and screamed:
— Ha-ha-ha! Come with us! Come with us! We are flying north to Lapland! To Lapland!
The domestic geese immediately forgot about Nils. They got excited, cackled, and flapped their wings, as if trying to see if they could take off. But the old goose—she was the grandmother of a good half of the geese—ran around them and screamed:
— You're crazy! You're crazy! Don't do anything stupid! After all, you are not some vagabonds, you are respectable domestic geese!
And then she lifted her head and shouted into the sky:
"We're fine here! We feel good here too!
Only one young goose did not listen to the advice of an old grandmother. Spreading his big white wings wide, he ran swiftly across the yard.
Wait for me, wait for me!"I'm flying with you!" he shouted. With you!
"Why, it's Martin, my mother's best goose," thought Nils. "Maybe he really will fly away!"
— Wait, wait! Nils shouted and rushed after Martin.
Nils barely caught up with him. He contrived, jumped up and, wrapping his arms around Martin's long neck, hung on to him. But the goose did not even feel it, as if Nils was not there, He flapped his wings violently — once, twice — and, without expecting it, took off into the air.
Before Nils realized what had happened, they were already high in the sky.

Chapter 2. Riding on goose
1
The wind beat in my face, tore my hair, howled and whistled in my ears. Nils sat astride Gus like a rider on a galloping horse: he hunched his head into his shoulders, cowered and pressed his whole body against Martin's neck. He clutched the goose feathers tightly with his hands and squeezed his eyes shut in fear. "I'm going to fall, I'm going to fall," he whispered with each flap of his big white wings. But ten minutes passed, twenty minutes, and he didn't fall. Finally, he took courage and opened his eyes a little.
Gray wings of wild geese flashed to the right and left, clouds floated over Nils's head, almost touching him, and far, far below the darkened earth. It didn't look like earth at all. It seemed as if someone had spread a huge plaid handkerchief under them. Some of the cells were completely black, others yellowish-gray, and others light green.
These were meadows covered with barely growing grass, and fields that had just been plowed.
Fields were replaced by dark forests, forests by lakes, lakes by fields again, and the geese flew and flew.
Nils is completely depressed,
"They might actually take me to Lapland!" he thought.
— Martin! Martin!— he shouted to the goose.— Turn back home! That's enough, we've been flying!
But Martin didn't say anything.
Then Nils spurred him with all his might with his wooden shoes.
Martin turned his head slightly and hissed,
"Listen, you! Sit still, or I'll throw you off.… Then you'll fly upside down!
I had to sit still.
2
All day long, Martin the white goose flew level with the whole flock, as if he had never been a domestic goose, as if he had done nothing but fly all his life.
"And where did he get such a rush from?" Nils wondered.
But by the evening, Martin still began to pass. Now everyone could see that he was flying for one day without a year: then suddenly he would fall behind, then he would rush forward, then he would fall into a hole, then he would jump up. And the wild geese saw it too.
— Akka Knebekaise! Akka Knebekaise! They shouted. — What do you want from me?— shouted the goose flying in front of everyone.
— The white one is lagging behind!
— He should know that flying fast is easier than flying slow!— the goose shouted, without even turning around. Martin tried to flap his wings harder and more often, but his tired wings became heavier and no longer obeyed him.
— Akka! Akka Knebekaise!
— What else do you need from me?
"A white man can't fly that high!"
— He should know that flying high is easier than flying low!
Poor Martin exerted his last strength and flew as high as he could. But then
his breath caught in his throat, and his wings became completely weak.
— Akka Knebekaise! White is falling!
— If you can't fly like us, let him stay at home, tell that to a white man! Akka shouted without slowing down.
"That's right, we'd better stay at home," Nils whispered and clung tighter to Martin's neck. Martin was falling down like a shot. It was lucky that some skinny vetla turned up at the bottom. Martin got caught on the top of a tree and got stuck among the branches.
So they sat on the wing.
